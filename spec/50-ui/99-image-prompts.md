# 🎨 Mind-Gardener Image Asset Prompts (Copy-Paste Ready)

## Global Constraints (반드시 포함)
Atmospheric realism.

Background: pure black (#000000), flat color only
No gradients, no texture, no vignette

Single plant object only
No pot, no soil, no ground
No environment, no background elements

Soft atmospheric lighting
Low contrast, readable silhouette
No harsh highlights, no deep shadows

Semi-realistic, restrained detail
Not photorealistic
Not illustrated, not cartoon, not stylized

Centered composition
Vertical orientation (9:16 safe)
Plenty of empty space around the plant

Designed as a “mystery growth state”
The species must NOT be identifiable

 A mysterious young tree-like plant in an early growth stage, a single central stem branching lightly upward, very small leaves or leaf hints only, structure suggests future growth, not completion, no flowers, no fruit, species must not be identifiable, centered composition, vertical orientation (9:16), background pure black (#000000), no pot, no soil, no ground, soft, diffused lighting, muted natural green and brown tones, low contrast, semi-realistic, restrained detail, designed as a mystery plant silhouette
